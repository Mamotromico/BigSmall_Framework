Big and Small Framework is a framework which adds a number of features to Rimworld.

It is perhaps best know for handling Pawns of different sizes, but it also contains a large number of other features, such as a much more robust system for gene Prerequisites, the abillity to conditionally toggle genes, and many other features.

The framework also contains all the code required to run the various Big & Small mods, such as handling of vampirism infection and reanimation.

On the Rendering end the framework has best compatibility if used together with HAR (Humanoid Alien Races). Used with HAR the framework also enables a number of other features, such as a robust way to change the race of pawns using genes.
